7. Inside this folder you should see the lisp projects

8. Open the empty lisp project you created

10. Now open the imported project and navigate to .indexes

11. Overwrite the properties.index with the one you copied

12. Restart Eclipse

13. Right click the imported project, highlight Team, select share project 
(this must be done since the project becomes unlinked from the repo upon overwritting the original properties.index)

15. Restart Eclipse

16. Project should be runnable, and associtaed with the repo

this again. If you never delete the local storage, you are freely able to pull and commit with no 
functionality problems.

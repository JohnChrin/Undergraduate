4 Programming Paradigms - Imperative : <b>Functional</b> : Logic : OOP \

## Introduction
This repository contains my educational background with LISP during a Programming Paradigms course at West Chester University. Parenthesis craziness.

## History
Year Invented: 1958

Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Beaten only by [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran). John McCarthy developed Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

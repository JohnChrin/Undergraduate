# Miscellaneous

## Introduction
Contained herein is a group of assignments associated with my Java-101 experience. The following folder includes things such as the first program I have ever written, and not suprisingly the second one as well (ha ha). My initial evaluation of my first programming class was based off of a single statement from the professor that really bothered me. \ 
"Programming is great, it can be anything, you can do anything" - Java-101 Professor \ 
I noticed a severe lack of structure in the class's delivery. Core concepts of the language that could of been encased in examples and explained, possibly even provide a barren template for the students so they develop some healthy habits such as where to declare instance, static, final (constants) variables would have been a stellar foot to start everyone off on, but in favor of accomplishing random swing enviornment assignments, the class managed to take us all over the place and leave us (maybe only me) with a million questions. I found the most difficult aspect of programming in college (and this spans the entirety of my education) was the balancing of multiple subjects alongside programming to be very difficult to manage.

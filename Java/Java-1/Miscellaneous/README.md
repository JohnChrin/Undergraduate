# Miscellaneous

## Introduction
Contained herein is a group of assignments associated with my Java-101 experience. The following folder includes things such as the first program I had ever written, and not suprisingly the second one as well (ha ha). My initial evaluation of my first programming class was based off of a single statement from the professor that really bothered me.

"Programming is great, it can be anything, you can do anything" - Java-101 Professor

I noticed a severe lack of structure in the class's delivery. Core concepts of the language that could of been encased in examples and explained, possibly even provide a barren template for the students so they develop some healthy habits such as where to declare instance, static, final (constants) variables would have been a stellar foot to start everyone off on, but in favor of accomplishing random swing enviornment assignments, the class managed to take us all over the place and leave us (maybe only me) with a million questions. I found the most difficult aspect of programming in college (and this spans the entirety of my education) was the balancing of multiple subjects alongside programming.

The problem of balancing is partially self-inflicted, since by the end of my 3.5 year experience, I had accured over 212 credits and merely only accomplished a bachelors degree.

## Improvements - Teaching Process
Stick with the Basics - Get your students coding immediately, so they can better appreciate what coding is. Keep that code very simple such as "Hello World". Possibly use JGRASP for this initial introduction (ensure it is pre-installed on a school lab  computer). Keeping the first day or so 100% focused on making an executable line of code so the student has a .java file that they have written themselves is important for the next step.

IDE / Java SDK / Paths - Taking a huge step back from coding and teaching students where they will write and build code and why they should do it there is a fundemental step in achieving clarity. Do not use simple IDE's like JGRASP; making the initial learning process increasingly burdensome with not result in a more proficient coder. Utilizing modern IDEs that are actually utilized in the industry such as Eclipse or IntelliJ not only provides the student with larger custimization potential, but also syntax assistance (after two semesters of JGRASP and finally exposing myself to Eclipse, I was disappointed and angry to say the least).

Ensure the entire installation process is visualized and described step-by-step. The assumption that students know why they are installing this software or that the process is trivial is a serious mistake on the teacher's part. Upon installation completion, walk them through pathing the Java JDK and importing their .java file into a project.

Now that you have an actual file to work on in your new IDE, have them append something simple to their code and show them how to save it. After that, the real educational process of exploring the features of the IDE such as preferences, formatting, dictionaries, plugins, autocomplete, ect... must be covered. Forgoing this process, however simple it may seem to an experience professor is a critical failure that the student has to deal with. Coding without going through this, is like trying to outfit a kitchen when the house is not constructed yet. Final note on this: Prepare a personal template of how to setup these settings and explain why you want your students to configure them your way for now (STRUCTURE).

SonarLint - Given how much there is to teach someone when introducing them to coding, having a supplemental instructor looming over their shoulder and pointing out every mistake without missing a beat should be every professor's #1 on their wishlist. SonarLint will do just that and while instructing the installation of it, teach your students to interact with the squid rules and if they cannot interpret why their code is underlined, they have you to provide clarity. This tool actually assists the professor by creating a queue for students to know to ask questions ("blue line?! help!").

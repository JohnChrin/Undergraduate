# ArrayEducation
## Introduction
Some of the following are very simple, but thats why they are lumped into a single project. The educational value of grasping how arrays work and how to manipulate them is a fundemental skill. The most interesting comprehension was  was the value of understanding array dimensions; 3d arrays happen to be a linear array of arrays.  

## Java Programs
[CellBills](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/CellBills.java) - Simple creation of a 6 element array; displays first and last values. \
[ComparingArrays](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/ComparingArrays.java) - Compares the length, then the elements in 2 arrays. \
[CopyingArrayElements](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/CopyingArrayElements.java) - Creates a redundant array length of the array being copied. \
[MaxArrayValue](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/MaxArrayValue.java) - Searches index values for the highest value in a linear fashion. \
[MaxMemberBill](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/MaxMemberBill.java) - Searches an array of cell phone bills, to find a family member's max bill. \
[OutputFamilyCellBills](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/OutputFamilyCellBills.java) - Outputs a 2d array in O(n^2) time. \
[PrintingArrayElements](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/PrintingArrayElements.java) - Simple creation of 6 element array; displays one-dimensional array. \
[ReadingDataIntoAnArray](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/ReadingDataIntoAnArray.java) - Trivial user inputting array information. \
[SumARowFamilyCellBills](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/SumARowFamilyCellBills.java) - User inputs month of cell phone bills they want summed. \
[SumEachRowFamilyCellBills](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/SumEachRowFamilyCellBills.java) - Sums each row, no user input. \
[SummingArrayElements](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/ArrayEducation/src/arrayEducation/SummingArrayElements.java) - One-dimensional array summation.

## Array Dimensions
Here is an example of a multiple dimensional array, I did not find anything that showcased it in this manner so I quickly drew it out. This demonstrates a one-dimensional array growing into a two-dim to three-dim array and how the lengths of them are determined dependent on the index cited. The biggest take away is the nesting of arrays in terms of dimensionality. It becomes an array of arrays of arrays to infinity.

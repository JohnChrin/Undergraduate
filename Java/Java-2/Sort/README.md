# Sort
## Introduction
Advanced array searching/sorting. 
## Java Programs
  * [BinarySearcher]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Sort/src/sort/BinarySearcher.java) – Works with sorted smallest to largest arrays. User inputs a number, searches from the center to either left or right depending on size of the number compared to the center’s value.
  * [LargestElementInAnArray](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Sort/src/sort/LargestElementInAnArray.java) – Recursively grabs the last element of the array and sets it as the highest number, then works backwards to the beginning changing the value if the next index is larger.
  * [MergeSort]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Sort/src/sort/MergeSort.java) – Merge sort was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. Interesting note, this algorithm was originally marked ‘’. Even more interesting, Java uses a modified iterative (non-recursive) version of this algorithm in their sort method when sorting objects; it also takes advantage of partially presorted lists which is far more functionality than my spaghetti implementation is. Merge sort falls somewhere in the middle of discovered sorting algorithms in terms of efficiency with a Big-O notation of O(n log n). Merge sort if often utilized for sorting linked lists due to the sequential nature of the task. This particular spaghetti needs refactoring.

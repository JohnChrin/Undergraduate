# Bank
## Introduction
The Bank job. We're in, we're out, 30 seconds... Okay, but seriously, this is a series of packages that all import and extend the original bank project's file called BankAccount(). The purpose to this series of projects was to explore the usage importing classes and then extending them. By importing and extending, we can use classes from separate packages as psuedo child classes. 

## Java Programs
 * [BankAccount](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bank/BankAccount.java) - Default class constructor that all of the following programs instantiate via importation and then by extension.
 * [Import/Extended Child](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv1/CheckingAccount.java) - [CheckingAccountClientv1](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv1/CheckingAccountClient.java) - 
 * [Import/Extended Child](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv2/CheckingAccount.java) - [CheckingAccountClientv2](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv2/CheckingAccountClient.java) - 
 * [Import/Extended Child](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv3/CheckingAccount.java) - [CheckingAccountClientv3](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv3/CheckingAccountClient.java) - 
 * [Import/Extended Child](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv4/CheckingAccount.java) - [CheckingAccountClientv4](https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/Bank/src/bankv4/CheckingAccountClient.java) -

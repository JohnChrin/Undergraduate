# HelloWorld
## Introduction
Primarily a grouping of recursion based projects, there is also a factorial calculator and an application of Serpinski’s Triangle.
## Java Programs
  * [Factorial]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/HelloWorld/src/helloWorld/Factorial.java) – User inputs a number they would like to see the factorial of.
  * [RecursiveFactorial]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/HelloWorld/src/helloWorld/RecursiveFactorial.java) – A factorial method that calls itself to solve itself.
  * [RecursiveFactorialWithTrace]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/HelloWorld/src/helloWorld/RecursiveFactorialWithTrace.java) – A factorial method that calls itself to solve itself, but with each step printed along the way.
  * [SierpinskiGasket]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-2/HelloWorld/src/helloWorld/SierpinskiGasket.java) – Generating a graphical depiction of equilateral triangles nested inside of one-another to create a fractal pattern.

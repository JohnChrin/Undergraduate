## Introduction
This program tracks the movement of your cursor with two eyeballs watching you.\
\
I had quite a bit of trouble updating this broken eyeball tracking swing application. I will eventually refactor the code to provide smoother tracking by making better use of Point() and built in Math. tools. I spent far too much time whiteboarding trigonometry, distance equations, equation of an ellipse, foci, ect... Spending more time applying variables from equations in math to a programming solution is needed to really curb my time at the drawingboard.

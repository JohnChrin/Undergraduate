# PassByReferenceJava
## Introduction
Passing by value means that when a variable is called to a function, the value of the variable is passed as the function’s argument (like a copy of a file). This is normally how people think when doing math. So if I gave you an equation of “x+x+x” and told you “x =3” then naturally “x+x+x=9”
Passing by reference means that when a variable is called to a function, the variable is passed as the function’s argument. “x=3” then “x+x+x=12”.
## Java Program
  * [Int] (https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-3/PassByReferenceJava/src/passByReferenceJava/Int.java) - [PassByReferenceJava]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-3/PassByReferenceJava/src/passByReferenceJava/PassByReference.java) – Int contains its own static int and methods to manipulate it. PassByReference creates an object of Int with an input of 3. Methods inside of PassByReference accept the object Int and utilize Int’s built in methods.

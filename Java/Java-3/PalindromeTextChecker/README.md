# PalindromeTextChecker
## Introduction
[Palindromes]( http://www.palindromelist.net/) are words that if spelled backwards would be the same word. An example of this behavior would be “civic” or “racecar” or “radar”. There are also palindrome sentences, but that is beyond the scope of this program.
## Java Program
  * [PalindromeTextChecker]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/Java/Java-3/PalindromeTextChecker/src/palindromeTextChecker/PalindromeTextChecker.java) – Reads a text file and scans it for palindrome words.

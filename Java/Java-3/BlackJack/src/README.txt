Plays an entire game of 1-on-1 BlackJack with only the option of "splitting"
being excluded. (This behavior requires actual betting to function.)

(HW_3_1 previous method)
Drafts a deck of cards via a String[] array return method. Spaces the indexes
evenly for easy printing.

Uses a ton of IF/ELSE IF/ELSE statements to control the flow of the game. I
wanted the game to play out in a human readable time-table, so I inserted a
few delays in the execution to allow the user to follow along.

I had so much fun with this one, I am a big gamer so this was almost as fun as
when I made a bingo game with J-Panels/Frames. With some simple modification
it could easily include multiple players, I would probably separate the dealer
method into two methods to apply the IF/ELSE loops to each player.

Hardest part was adding the high/low aces.

# Ask user to input "Loan Amount" & "Years".
p = input("Loan amount? \n")
y = input("How many years do you want the loan to be? \n")

# Convert variables from "Strings" to "Floats".
p = int(p)
y = int(y)						

# Fixed variables for loan calculations.
# 	t = time per year interest is compounded.
# 	ifs = federal subsidized interest rate as a decimal.
# 	ius = federal unsubsidized interest rate as a decimal.
# 	iup = PLUS unsubsidized interest rate as a decimal.
# 	ffs = federal sub/unsub fee rate of the loan.
# 	fup = PLUS unsub fee rate of the loan.

# 	pus = new principle fed unsub

# 	f = fee fed sub loan
# 	fus = fee fed unsub loan
# 	fupp = fee PLUS loan

## Introduction
This repository contains my educational background with LISP during a Programming Paradigms course at West Chester University. Parenthesis craziness.

## History
ML Year Invented: 1973 \
SML Year Invented: 1997

Meta Language (ML) has its roots in LISP and has an interesting feature of assigning types to most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations. ML makes intensive use of pattern matching for just about everything it does. Robin Milner and his colleagues at the University of Edinburgh are credited with the first implementation of ML. MacQueen in 1984 is credited with purposing the Standard ML modules system.

# PassByReferenceC
## Introduction
Provides an example of doing an illogical mathematical maneuver known as pass by reference. Instead of taking the original value of a variable and using it in multiple places, every time that variable is called, it is updated. 
## C++ Program
  * [Int]( https://github.com/Spades86/Undergraduate/blob/master/C/PassByReferenceC/src/Int.cpp) - Takes the value “ x = 3 “ and does the math operations of “square(x) + twice(x) + once(x)”.

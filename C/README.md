## History
C Year Invented: 1972
C++ Year Invented: 1983

Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson implemented the first variant of the Unix operating system in [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language). Thompson tried to make a [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) compiler but decided it was not worth it and made a new programming language called [B language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)), but then B was too slow. In 1972 Ritchie improved B and which therein created C.

In 1979 Bjarne Stroustrup (Danish computer scientist) started to work on creating "C with Classes". Being motivated by his Ph.D. thesis, in 1983 "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" which relates to the increment feature of C.
